For learning PostgreSQL and SQL, it's recommended to set up a local development environment or use an online environment where you can directly interact with the database. 
Here are some alternatives:

+ Local Development:
  - Install PostgreSQL on your computer.
  - Use a SQL client such as pgAdmin or DBeaver to interact with the database.
+ Online Database Services:
  - Consider using online database services that provide a web-based interface for managing databases.
  - Examples include ElephantSQL and Aiven.
+ Interactive Tutorials:
  - Explore online platforms and tutorials that provide interactive SQL learning environments.
  - Websites like SQLZoo and Mode Analytics offer hands-on SQL exercises.
+ Cloud Platforms:
  - Utilize cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure to create PostgreSQL instances and manage databases through their web consoles.
