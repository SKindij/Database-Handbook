# Introduction to PostgreSQL

> PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California at Berkeley and has more than 35 years of active development on the core platform.

For learning PostgreSQL and SQL, it's recommended to set up a local development environment or use an online environment where you can directly interact with the database. 
Here are some alternatives:

+ **Local Development:**
  - Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) on your computer.
  - Use a SQL client such as pgAdmin or DBeaver to interact with the database.
+ **Online Database Services:**
  - Consider using online database services that provide a web-based interface for managing databases.
  - Examples include ElephantSQL and Aiven.
+ **Interactive Tutorials:**
  - Explore online platforms and tutorials that provide interactive SQL learning environments.
  - Websites like SQLZoo and Mode Analytics offer hands-on SQL exercises.
+ **Cloud Platforms:**
  - Utilize cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure to create PostgreSQL instances and manage databases through their web consoles.
