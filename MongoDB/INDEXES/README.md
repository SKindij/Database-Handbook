# ðŸ“š What is indexing?

## <a name="creating"></a>ðŸ“– Creating indexes
&ensp; **Indexes** are a powerful feature in MongoDB that help improve the performance of read operations (queries) in your database. 
They work similarly to the indexes found in a book, where you can quickly locate specific information rather than scanning through the entire content. 

&ensp; Basically, an **index** in MongoDB is a data structure that holds a smaller version of the data in our documents, along with a reference to the original document. 
**Indexes** can be created on one or more fields in a MongoDB collection. The default index that exists in every collection is the _id index, which ensures unique values for the _id field.

&ensp; To create an index on a field or fields, you can use the ``createIndex()`` method.\
To see which index is being used for a specific query, you can use the ``explain()`` method. 

## <a name="types"></a>ðŸ“– Index types
+ Single Field: Index based on a single field in the documents:
+ Compound: Index based on multiple fields in the documents:
+ Multikey: Index used when the indexed field contains an array of values:
+ Text: Index used to support text search queries on string content:
+ 2dsphere: Index used to support geospatial queries on spherical data:
+ 2d: Index used to support geospatial queries on planar data:

> ```javascript
>  // if you frequently query collection by name,
>  // create single-field index on "name" field to improve performance of those queries
>    db.witcherCharacters.createIndex({ name: 1 });
>  
>  // if you frequently query by both "profession" and "status" fields
>  // create compound index on "profession" and "status" fields
>    db.witcherCharacters.createIndex({ profession: 1, status: 1 });
>  
>  // suppose "witcherMonsters" has large number of docs and each document has array of "tags"
>  // if you frequently query based on those tags, and array may contain multiple values
>    db.witcherMonsters.createIndex({ tags: 1 });
>
>  // suppose "witcherBooks" has large number of documents,
>  // you frequently search for books based on keywords in "description" field
>    db.witcherBooks.createIndex({ description: 'text' });
>
>  // suppose each document has "location" field containing latitude and longitude of monster
>  // you frequently query for monsters within certain distance of a given point
>    db.witcherMonsters.createIndex({ location: '2dsphere' });
>
>  // suppose each document has "location" field containing x and y coordinates of character
>  // tou frequently query for characters within certain distance of a given point
>    db.witcherCharacters.createIndex({ location: '2d' });

## <a name="optimization"></a>ðŸ“– Query Optimization
&ensp; It is a crucial aspect to ensure efficient and fast retrieval of data. The **query optimizer** helps in the selection of the appropriate query plan, enabling MongoDB to execute queries efficiently. The query optimizerâ€™s primary goal is to minimize the number of documents to be read or scanned, consequently reducing the overall execution time.

&ensp; One of the most important techniques for optimizing query performance is the use of indexes. They improve query performance by minimizing the number of documents to be scanned, thus reducing the overall execution time.\

&ensp; MongoDB provides the ``explain()`` method, which is an essential tool for understanding the behavior and performance of your queries. By using ``explain()``, you can identify the query plan used, evaluate the effectiveness of an index, and debug queries.
> ```javascript
>  // query the "witcherCharacters" collection and explain how it's executed
>  const query = { status: 'alive', profession: 'witcher' };
>  const cursor = db.witcherCharacters.find(query).explain();
>  
>  // print the explain output to the console
>  printjson(cursor);
> ```

&ensp; The **MongoDB profiler** is a feature that allows you to track the performance of MongoDB operations. It can help you identify slow or inefficient queries, and optimize your database by providing information on how queries are executed and how long they take to run. **Profiler** can be configured to collect data on all operations, or only those that take longer than a specified threshold. 
&ensp; There are three different levels of profiling:
- 0: Profiling is off
- 1: Collects data on slow operations only
- 2: Collects data on all operations

&ensp; To optimize queries, you can apply limits and use projections in your queries. 
+ **Limits** allow you to restrict the number of documents returned during a query, which eventually reduces the amount of data transferred between the server and your application.
+ **Projections** allow you to specify the fields to return in the query results. This means that only the required fields are retrieved, thus reducing the overall document size and improving the query performance.
