## <a name="creating"></a>ðŸ“– Creating indexes
&ensp; **Indexes** are a powerful feature in MongoDB that help improve the performance of read operations (queries) in your database. 
They work similarly to the indexes found in a book, where you can quickly locate specific information rather than scanning through the entire content. 

&ensp; Basically, an **index** in MongoDB is a data structure that holds a smaller version of the data in our documents, along with a reference to the original document. 
**Indexes** can be created on one or more fields in a MongoDB collection. The default index that exists in every collection is the _id index, which ensures unique values for the _id field.
