# ðŸ“š Introduction to MongoDB

## ðŸ“– What is MongoDB?
&ensp; It is a NoSQL (non-relational) document-oriented database. It was first released in 2009 and is developed by MongoDB Inc. MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which makes it easy to store and retrieve data. It is used by many large organizations, such as Cisco, eBay, and SAP.\
&ensp; It is designed to be scalable and flexible, making it a popular choice for handling large amounts of data. It also supports many features, such as indexing, replication, and sharding, which make it a robust database solution.\
&ensp; One of the unique features of MongoDB is its ability to store data in a flexible schema. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not enforce a rigid schema, which means you can add or remove fields to a document as needed. This makes it easier to work with data that may not have a fixed structure.

## ðŸ“– Advantages of using MongoDB
+ It is very flexible, making it easier to work with data that may not have a fixed structure. This means that you can easily store data in a way that makes sense for your application.
+ It is designed to be scalable, which means you can easily add more servers to handle larger amounts of data. It also supports sharding, which allows you to distribute data across multiple servers.
+ Document-based data model and indexing features make it a high-performance database. It can handle large amounts of data and provide fast query response times.
+ It supports a rich query language that allows you to easily retrieve and manipulate data. It also supports aggregation, which allows you to perform complex data analysis.
+ MongoDB supports replication, which means you can have multiple copies of your data for increased availability and durability.
+ Large and active community of users and developers. There are many resources available to help you learn and use the database.

## ðŸ“– Key concepts and terminology
+ Documents: 
  * MongoDB stores data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects. 
  * Document is a set of key-value pairs, where each key represents a field in the document and the corresponding value represents the data stored in that field.
+ Collections: 
  * It is a group of related documents in MongoDB. 
  * Collections are similar to tables in relational databases, but unlike tables, they do not enforce a fixed schema.
+ Indexes: 
  * They help to speed up queries by providing efficient access to data.
  * They are similar to indexes in relational databases, but they work differently in MongoDB. 
  * MongoDB supports several types of indexes, including single-field indexes, compound indexes, and geospatial indexes.
+ Aggregation: 
  * It allows you to perform complex data analysis by grouping, filtering, and transforming data in a collection. 
  * Aggregation pipelines consist of multiple stages, each of which performs a specific operation on the data.
+ Sharding: 
  * It is a method for distributing data across multiple servers in MongoDB. 
  * It allows you to scale horizontally by adding more servers to handle increased load.
+ Replica sets: 
  * It is a group of MongoDB servers that work together to provide high availability and data redundancy. 
  * It consists of one primary server and one or more secondary servers, which replicate data from the primary server.
+ GridFS: 
  * It is a specification for storing large files in MongoDB. 
  * It stores files in chunks, which are then stored as separate documents in a collection.
