## <a name="transactions"></a>ðŸ“– Transactions
&ensp; They play a vital role in maintaining data consistency and integrity within a database. They represent a single unit of work that consists of multiple operations executed in a sequence.

### Overview
&ensp; MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, enabling you to perform multiple read and write operations across several documents within a single, atomic transaction. 
A transaction might involve several operations, for instance:
* Creating a new document
* Updating an existing document
* Deleting a document
* Reading documents

&ensp; The fundamental purpose of a transaction is to either execute all or none of its operations. This means that, in case any operation within the transaction fails, the entire transaction will be aborted, and the database will return to its initial state, thus ensuring data consistency.

&ensp; Transactions in MongoDB are essential to achieve the following ACID properties:
+ Atomicity: Ensures that either all the operations in the transaction are executed, or none are.
+ Consistency: Guarantees that, upon completing a transaction, the database remains in a consistent state.
+ Isolation: Secures that the operations within the transaction are isolated from other transactions being executed simultaneously.
+ Durability: Warrants that once a transaction is successfully completed, its effects will be stored persistently in the database.

### Usage
&ensp; To begin a transaction in MongoDB, youâ€™ll need to obtain a session and then start the transaction using the startTransaction() method. After performing the necessary operations, you may commit the transaction to apply the changes to the database, or abort to discard the changes.

> Example 1: Creating transaction to add new Witcher and update their current location
> > ```javascript
> >  // start by creating new session
> >  // session will be used to group operations of our transaction
> >  const session = await mongoose.startSession();
> >    // this marks start of our atomic operation
> >    session.startTransaction();
> >

> >          { new: true, session }
> >      ); 
> >     // if all operations are successful, we call this to commit transaction
> >     // this will persist all changes made within transaction to database
> >      await session.commitTransaction();

## <a name="scaling"></a>ðŸ“– Scaling Strategies
&ensp;Scaling is crucial for maintaining high performance and availability of your database, especially as your application and its data grow.

### Horizontal Scaling
&ensp;It refers to the process of adding more servers to a system to share the workload evenly.

#### Sharding
&ensp; It is a method of spreading data across multiple servers, allowing MongoDB to scale out and manage large amounts of data. Sharding enables you to partition your data and distribute it across several machines, ensuring that no single machine is overwhelmed with data or queries. With the use of a shard key, MongoDB automatically distributes data across the multiple machines.

&ensp; Components of Sharding
+ Shard: 
  * single server or a replica set that stores a portion of the sharded data.
+ Config Server: 
  * server or a replica set that stores metadata about the sharded clusters. 
  * config server tracks which data is stored on which shard.
+ Query Router (mongos): 
  * server that routes the application queries to the appropriate shard based on the metadata obtained from the config server.


### Vertical Scaling
&ensp; It involves increasing the resources available on individual servers, such as CPU, memory, and storage. This can be done by adding more resources to existing servers or by upgrading to more powerful servers.

#### Replica Sets
