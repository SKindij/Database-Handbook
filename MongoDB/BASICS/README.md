### BSON vs JSON

&ensp; BSON is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. It is designed to be efficient in storage, traversability, and encoding/decoding. 
Some of its key features include:
+ Binary Encoding: 
  * BSON encodes data in a binary format, which offers better performance and allows the storage of data types not supported by JSON.
+ Support for Additional Data Types: 
  * BSON supports more data types compared to JSON, such as Date, Binary, ObjectId, and Decimal128. This makes it possible to represent diverse data more accurately in MongoDB documents.
+ Efficient Traversability: 
  * In BSON, the size of each element is encoded, which makes it easy to skip over elements, thus making the traversal faster.

Some features of JSON include:
+ Human-readable: 
  * JSON is textual with a simple structure, making it easy for humans to read and write.
+ Interoperable: 
  * JSON can be easily parsed and generated by many different programming languages, making it a popular choice for data interchange between applications.
+ Limited Data Types: 
  * This means that some data, like dates or binary data, must be represented as strings or custom objects in JSON.

### Data Types
&ensp; In MongoDB, data is stored in **BSON** format, which supports various data types. 
Understanding these data types is essential as they play a crucial role in schema design and query performance.\
&ensp; The following is a brief summary of the different data types supported in MongoDB.

&ensp; We can consider this subtopic on the basis of the "The Witcher" universe.
+ **String**
  * it is used to store text; 
  * for example: character's name;
+ **Integer**
  * it is used to store whole numbers;
  * MongoDB supports 32-bit and 64-bit integers;
  * for example: character's age;
+ **Double**
  * it is used to store floating-point numbers;
  * for example: character's weight & height;
+ **Boolean**
  * it is used to store true or false values;
  * for example: whether a character is a monster or not;
+ **Date**
  * it is used to store dates and times;
  * Dates are stored as UTC times;
  * for example: character's date of birth;

> ```MongoDB
>  {
>    name: "Geralt of Rivia",
>    age: 100,
>    weight: 90.5,
>    height: 190.0,
>    occupation: "Witcher",
>    monster: false,
>    weapon: "Silver sword",
>    catchphrase: "Evil is evil. Lesser, greater, middling, it's all the same.",
>  },
>  
>  {
>    name: "Ciri",
>    age: 22,
>    monster: false,
>    occupation: "Princess",
>    location: "Kaer Morhen",
>  },
>  
>  {
>    name: "Yennefer of Vengerberg",
>    dateOfBirth: new Date("1173-02-09"),
>    occupation: "Sorceress",
>  }
> ```



+ **ObjectID**
  * it is used to store unique identifiers for documents in collection;
  * MongoDB generates ObjectIDs automatically when you insert a new document;
  * for example: 
+ **Array**
  * it is used to store an ordered list of values;
  * You can store multiple data types in an array.

**Binary data**
it is used to store binary data, such as images or audio files.

**Regular expression**
it is used to store regular expressions, which are used to match patterns in strings.

**Null**
it is used to store a null value.
