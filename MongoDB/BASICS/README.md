### BSON vs JSON

&ensp; BSON is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. It is designed to be efficient in storage, traversability, and encoding/decoding. 
Some of its key features include:
+ Binary Encoding: 
  * BSON encodes data in a binary format, which offers better performance and allows the storage of data types not supported by JSON.
+ Support for Additional Data Types: 
  * BSON supports more data types compared to JSON, such as Date, Binary, ObjectId, and Decimal128. This makes it possible to represent diverse data more accurately in MongoDB documents.
+ Efficient Traversability: 
  * In BSON, the size of each element is encoded, which makes it easy to skip over elements, thus making the traversal faster.

Some features of JSON include:
+ Human-readable: 
  * JSON is textual with a simple structure, making it easy for humans to read and write.
+ Interoperable: 
  * JSON can be easily parsed and generated by many different programming languages, making it a popular choice for data interchange between applications.
+ Limited Data Types: 
  * This means that some data, like dates or binary data, must be represented as strings or custom objects in JSON.

### Data Types
&ensp; In MongoDB, data is stored in **BSON** format, which supports various data types. 
Understanding these data types is essential as they play a crucial role in schema design and query performance.\
&ensp; The following is a brief summary of the different data types supported in MongoDB.
