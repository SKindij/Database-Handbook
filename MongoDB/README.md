# MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular **NoSQL database** that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is often used in Node.js applications because it can handle large volumes of unstructured data and is highly scalable.

> * The official **MongoDB documentation** is a great place to start learning about the database. It covers everything from getting started with MongoDB to advanced topics such as indexing, replication, and sharding.
> * **MongoDB University** offers a range of free online courses and certifications on MongoDB. These courses cover everything from the basics of MongoDB to more advanced topics such as MongoDB performance tuning and database administration.
> * **MongoDB Atlas** is a fully-managed cloud database service that allows you to easily deploy, operate, and scale your MongoDB deployments. You can use it to experiment with MongoDB and learn more about the database.
> * There are many **online tutorials and videos** available on platforms like **YouTube and Udemy** that can help you learn MongoDB. These resources often provide step-by-step instructions and real-world examples to help you understand the concepts better.
> * The **MongoDB community** is very active and helpful. You can ask questions and get answers from other users and experts on the MongoDB community forums.
