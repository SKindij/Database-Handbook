# ðŸ“š What is aggregation?
It is the process of transforming data in MongoDB by grouping together documents and performing calculations on those groups. 
**Aggregation** is a powerful feature in MongoDB that allows you to analyze and manipulate data in various ways.

MongoDB aggregation framework provides a set of operators to perform various operations on the data. 
  + The aggregation pipeline is a sequence of these operators that transform the documents as they pass through the pipeline. 
  + The pipeline consists of stages, and each stage performs a specific operation on the data.

## <a name="pipeline"></a>ðŸ“– Aggregation pipeline stages
+ ``$match`` - filters documents based on a specified condition.
+ ``$group`` - groups documents by a specified field and calculates aggregate values for each group.
+ ``$project`` - reshapes documents by including or excluding fields, creating computed fields, or renaming fields.
+ ``$sort`` - sorts documents based on one or more fields.
+ ``$skip`` - skips a specified number of documents in the pipeline.
+ ``$limit`` - limits the number of documents returned by the pipeline.


## <a name="operators"></a>ðŸ“– Aggregation operators
They are used to perform various operations on the data as it passes through the pipeline. 
+ ``$sum`` - calculates the sum of a specified field in a group of documents.
+ ``$avg`` - calculates the average of a specified field in a group of documents.
+ ``$max`` - returns the maximum value of a specified field in a group of documents.
+ ``$min`` - returns the minimum value of a specified field in a group of documents.
+ ``$push`` - adds a value to an array.
+ ``$addToSet`` - adds a value to an array only if it does not already exist in the array.
