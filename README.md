topic: ðŸ¦‰ databases that will be used together with node.js

## types of databases:

* **Relational databases** are organized using tables with predefined relationships between them. Data is stored in rows and columns, and the relationships between tables are defined using keys:
  + **Postgres SQL**, MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
* **NoSQL databases** use a flexible schema and are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data. They do not use tables, and instead store data in document, key-value, or graph formats:
  + **MongoDB**, Cassandra, and Redis.
* **Object-oriented databases** are designed to store complex data types like objects and classes, and are often used in software development. They allow developers to store and manipulate data in an object-oriented way, and provide features like inheritance and encapsulation:
  + db4o and ObjectStore.
* Hierarchical databases organize data in a tree-like structure, with each record having one parent and possibly many children. They are often used in mainframe environments:
  + *IBM's Information Management System (IMS) and *the Windows Registry.
